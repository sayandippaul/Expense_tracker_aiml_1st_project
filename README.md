# 💸 Personal Expense Data Analysis Project

This is my first AI/ML-based project where I analyzed personal expense data using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**.  
The goal of this project is to visualize how expenses vary by week, category, and date to better understand personal spending habits.
